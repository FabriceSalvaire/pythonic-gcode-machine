How to get help or report an issue ?
------------------------------------

.. There is no mailing list or forum actually, so you can either contact me or fill an issue on Github.

..  If you want to **discuss or ask questions on PythonicGcodeMachine**, you can subscribe and post messages on the
..  **PythonicGcodeMachine User** mailing list.
..
..  There is actually three lists running on Google Groups (*):
..
..  `User List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/PythonicGcodeMachine-user>`_
..    List for PythonicGcodeMachine users
..  `Announce List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/PythonicGcodeMachine-announce>`_
..    List for announcements regarding PythonicGcodeMachine releases and development
..  `Devel List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/PythonicGcodeMachine-devel>`_
..    List for developers of PythonicGcodeMachine

**If you encounter an issue, please fill an issue** on the `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/FabriceSalvaire/PythonicGcodeMachine/issues>`_.

..  (*) Despite Google Groups has many drawbacks, I don't have actually enough resources to run GNU Mailman or
    Discourse on my own IT infrastructure.
